Welcome to Public Tennis Club!
NYC Tennis Match Booking App

This is an SPA to schedule tennis matches at various clubs all over New York City!

The app has navigation at the top: about, home, clubs, matches, sign-up, login, logout.
The site is secure and requires a login to see your individual matches. 
Users can sign up and create a profile with a picture, username and more.

All users can see all 5 area tennis clubs, but you must be logged in to
see your matches.

Users can: 
    -add a match to a club, delete a match, and edit your match. 
    -invite another user to play a tennis match, these match invites are handled with ActionMailer.
    -see if your match is pending, accepted, or rejected and sort accordingly.
    -can leave comments on a completed match with your tennis partner
