Welcome to Public Tennis Club!
NYC Tennis Match Booking App

This is an SPA to schedule tennis matches at various clubs all over New York City!

The cost of this booking app is a $5 one-time flat fee. It is payable through
the Stripe API. For purposes of the App, this is in testing mode and is functional,
but no money is exchanged and all account information is "blank" in test mode.

The app has 5 navigation buttons at the top: home, clubs, pending matches, accepted mathces,   
The site is secure and requires a login to see your individual matches. 
All users can see all the tennis clubs. 
You can add a match to a club, delete a match, and edit your match. 
You can invite another user to play a tennis match. You can see if your match is pending, accepted, or rejected.
These invites are handled with ActionMailer.
