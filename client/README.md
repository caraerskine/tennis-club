Welcome to Public Tennis Club!
NYC Tennis Match Booking App

This is an SPA to schedule tennis matches at various clubs all over New York City!

The cost of this booking app is a $5 one-time flat fee. It is payable through
the Stripe API. For purposes of the App, this is in testing mode and is functional,
but no money is exchanged and all account information is "blank" in test mode.

The app has 5 navigation buttons at the top: home, clubs, pending matches, accepted mathces,   
The site is secure and requires a login to see your individual games. All users can see all the basketball courts. You can add a game to a court, delete a game, and edit your game. You can also add a court to the list of courts.

How to run it: -You must have the backend running to make this project work. In the console, run rails s from within the directory pickup-bball

-You need React to run the front end from within the directory pickup-bball Run npm install and npm run server Open a second terminal window and run npm start

STRETCH GOALS: -Add photo of park/court

-A user can make a 5 on 5 game and a user of the same skill level can join the game

-Have a user profile with a photo

-Request to join a game Say there are 9 people signed up, and you need a 10th for 5 on 5, you could be the 10th person and complete the game. I'm thinking you could send a request to the person who created the game, and then they can decide to add you or not, based on skill level, etc. A little like "choosing teams".

-Have your skill level on you profile public, and others at that skill level can invite you to join a game and you can invite others as well.

-Show how many people have joined a game

Let's hoop! üèÄ
